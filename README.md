Welcome to My 10-Minute Calculator 🕒

So, I had 10 minutes to kill and decided to make a calculator. No fancy UI. No executable. Just pure Python glory. It's a calculator that works… kind of. If you're looking for a sleek app with buttons and everything, well, this ain't it.

And here's the best part: You can literally write anything on the little screen! Want to perform calculations? Sure. Want to type "hello world" just because? Go ahead, the calculator doesn't judge. 😏
Features:

    Addition: Because math needs to add up.
    Subtraction: For when you want to take things away.
    Multiplication: It’s like adding, but faster!
    Custom Input: Write anything on the screen. Seriously, anything. It’s a free-for-all!

How to Use:

    Clone this repository. It’s only 10 minutes of code, but feel free to spend hours on it, just like I did.
    Run the .py file. No fancy .exe here, folks. This is authentic Python.
    Type in your calculations (or random words — no one’s stopping you).
    Watch the terminal work its magic. Expect the unexpected.

Why Python?

Because Python is awesome, and this was a 10-minute project, so I didn’t need anything more complicated.
Caveat:

    This project doesn’t check for crazy input. So if you try to divide by zero, you’ll get a friendly Python error message instead of an apology.
    There’s no fancy GUI. Your terminal is the canvas. Deal with it. 😎
    Also, if you input gibberish, it might just spit out something weird. Consider this a feature.

Contributions

If you’re a mad genius who thinks you can turn this into a fully functional app, please feel free to fork, pull request, and show me how it’s done. But remember, it was made in 10 minutes — no pressure!
